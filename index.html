      <h1>Defog Your Chromebook</h1>
      <p>E-Halcyon is an exploit to bypass "The Fog", which is Google's mitigation for the unenrollment and downgrading of Chrome OS devices. It allows you to downgrade and bypass enterprise enrollment on Chromebooks, even if it has received the update that patches downgrading and enrollment escape.</p>
      <p>E-Halcyon is developed by Mercury Workshop, the same developers behind SH1MMER.</p>

      <h1>Instructions:</h1>

      <!-- note: please just enable word wrap on your editor instead of screwing up the indentation for everyone else -->
      <!-- coolelectronics, you better disable your auto-formatter -->
      <p>To build the modified recovery image yourself, you'll need a Linux PC or VM (Virtual Machine). WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) is not guaranteed to work. If you want a prebuilt modified recovery image, you can find one corresponding to your board at <a href="https://dl.osu.bio/">dl.osu.bio</a>, download it, and directly boot it after flashing it to a USB Drive.</p>
      <p>Now, you'll need to boot into <a href="https://sh1mmer.me">SH1MMER</a> on your Chromebook, and press the Un-Enroll option. It won't truly unenroll you if you've received the 112 update patching unenrollment and downgrading, but it still is a necessary step for the rest of the procedure. If you've never used SH1MMER before or don't have an image lying around, make sure to follow all the instructions on <a href="https://sh1mmer.me">sh1mmer.me</a> before proceeding with the rest of the tutorial here.</p>
      <p>Next, if you're building the recovery image, you need a version 107 recovery image corresponding to your board, which you can pick up from <a href="https://chrome100.dev">chrome100.dev</a>. Once you've downloaded the right image for your board and have confirmed it's for version 107, unzip it and save it to a safe place. Now, open up a terminal and type in the following commands:</p>
      
      <!--have to do this or else you get weird indentation on the rendered page-->
      <pre>git clone https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/RecoMod
cd RecoMod
chmod +x recomod.sh
sudo ./recomod.sh -i /path/to/recovery/image.bin --halcyon --rw_legacy</pre>

      <p>[Ensure that you substitute <i>/path/to/recovery/image.bin</i> with the precise file path; as in indicating the location of your recovery image within your files application.]</p>
      <p>The script will modify the image in place, and it can now be flashed with a standard recovery tool onto a USB drive of your choice.</p>
      <p>Exit SH1MMER and press <i>"Power (⏻) + Reload (↻) + ESC"</i> to get back to the recovery screen. Make sure developer mode is enabled, then plug in the USB. Once the recovery screen shows up, you need to start spamming the E key on your keyboard. It will begin a 5 minute wait sequence, and near the end of the 5 minutes start spamming E again. You will only have to wait 5 minutes once, subsequent boots will have the 5 minute wait omitted.</p>
      <p>The boot splash will show, and you will enter a special menu. First, navigate to "Reset System" using the arrow keys, press enter, and consent to reset your device. Next, it will show the types of reset methods. Navigate to "Pressurewash" and click enter. It should finish in a few moments.</p>
      <p>Lastly, Use the arrow keys to navigate the cursor to "Activate Halcyon Environment" and press enter. Then navigate to "Install Halcyon Semi-Tethered", press enter, and wait for it to install. Once done, navigate to "Activate Halcyon Environment" again, and click "Boot Halcyon Semi-Tethered". You should now be booted into a downgraded and unenrolled ChromeOS environment with developer mode enabled.</p>

      <ul>
        <!-- using h2 here for some actual hierarchy and no ugly css -->
        <li>
          <h2>How does this work?</h2>
          <p>See the <a href="https://coolelectronics.me/blog/breaking-cros-5">writeup</a> for more information.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Can the admins see that I'm doing this?</h2>
          <p>No.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Why doesn't my Chromebook's local data in Halcyon save after a reboot?</h2>
          <p>Unfixable restriction of cryptohome. See the <a href="https://coolelectronics.me/blog/breaking-cros-5">writeup</a> for more information.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Why does my Chromebook screen show "Missing or damaged", or "Confirm returning to secure mode" when I power off/reboot in Halcyon?</h2>
          <p>After installing E-Halcyon, you won't be able to boot Chrome OS normally. You'll have to keep the USB drive around to jumpstart the booting process.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Where do I report bugs?</h2>
          <p>The RecoMod <a href="//github.com/MercuryWorkshop/RecoMod">GitHub</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Why does it say "E mode not activated" when I try to boot Halcyon in the RecoMod menu?</h2>
          <p>You spammed the E key when starting at the wrong time, or not at all.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Why does booting Halcyon still show enterprise enrollment?</h2>
          <p>You forgot to click "Pressurewash" on the RecoMod menu before installing and booting Halcyon.</p>
